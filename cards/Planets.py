# TODO (TASK 6.1): Implement the Planet Card system for Balatro.
#   Create a dictionary called PLANETS that stores all available PlanetCard objects.
#   Each entry should use the planet's name as the key and a PlanetCard instance as the value.
#   Each PlanetCard must include:
#       - name: the planet's name (e.g., "Mars")
#       - description: the hand it levels up or affects
#       - price: how much it costs to purchase
#       - chips: the chip bonus it provides
#       - mult: the multiplier it applies
#   Example structure:
#       "Gusty Garden": PlanetCard("Gusty Garden", "levels up galaxy", 6, 15, 7)
#   Include all planets up to "Sun" to complete the set.
#   These cards will be used in the shop and gameplay systems to upgrade specific poker hands.
